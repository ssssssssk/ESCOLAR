Stand planted so that you are centered 
with the Earth's gravitational pull. 
Feel its force grounding you
like a tree trunk rooting, sculpting, 
bond with the ground below, below.

It's about feelings 
on the horizontal axis.
 
Horizontality is a democratic circumstance
level with the mind. 

Calling all pollinators
