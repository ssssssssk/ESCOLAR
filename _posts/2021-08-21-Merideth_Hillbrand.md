Here, a field, <br>
a wide view, <br>
an eye on the horizon<br>
within a periphery. <br>
Objects come and flow through systems <br>
we use them, <br>
we waste them, <br>
we wear them out <br>
and on the other end— <br>
      the waste stream. <br>
When forms have been in the world awhile, <br>
they have a grime.<br>
Circulating and rotating <br>
through waste stream sludge, <br>
Pauses in a circuit based horizontality, <br>
supply chain blockage. <br>
We encounter through the lateral, network through a horizontal window. <br>
Feedback loops and tipping points. <br>
Approaching virtual <br>
by being close to something without actually being it. <br>
The felt distance between two poles, <br>
time-being <br>
and <br>
time-sensing.<br>


Another point of entry: Medieval charms, objects from a time before literacy when written language could be ingested instead of read. Contemplation and sight as a form of touch. Text is an exchange in this sense, something to be given. Chemically sensitive, text is hidden, folded, embedded, ingested, and touched with a potential to tilt, rotate, and spin. Poetics can be a shell, a vague perimeter that embraces and contains — a poetics that encapsulates both legible and illegible fragments— coalescing to communicate variations on utility. A process of composition and decomposition. Analogous to plants, bud-like. Part of a process in a centuries long effort to arrest the image and fix it. Casting, like photography, is a printing process with objects. Here, text and images have been rotationally cast with urethane resin. You start with the ball, make a negative impression, pour into the negative some sort of system towards a positive. Here— in the copy— the positive is a shell, a thin space between an inside and outside. Doubling instead of dichotomy, having synonym siblings instead of contradictions. In holding it (the text/image/material) captive, a support structure emerges. Circumscribing around a horizontal structure to enclose, partial and poetic, a network for things holding things.
