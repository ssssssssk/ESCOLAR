Something like a wall 

that we can’t yet navigate.

A living puzzle, 

its language too complex to speak.

An intervention or boundary.

When neglected, 

becomes an encroaching menace.

A constant crisis,

through the eyes of the Architect.

Its existence, an undulating slapstick.

We flail and collapse, 

struggling to see around its corners.

Hedge trimmers are out 

and we’re tripping over the cord.

The wisest of us 

will surrender in its shadow.
