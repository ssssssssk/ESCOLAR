John Brockley is a sculptor and painter working in Southern California. His current series of paintings are based on two sets of photographs.  The first was taken with an inexpensive dashboard cam during a 2016 cross country road trip.  The second set was taken with the backup camera of a Renault during a driving trip across Europe.  Brockley’s attention elevates the qualities of light, technical imperfections, perceptual mediums and mundane subjects that often times remain overlooked or invisible.  In an inversion of the pastoral landscape tradition, Brockley’s contemporary still lifes and highway and parking lot vistas are at once ethereal, spare, and haunting.  They  render the foreign familiar and the familiar novel, all the while suggesting the ways in which modern day objects and fabrication  frame and mediate our perception of the natural world.
