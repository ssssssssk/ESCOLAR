Escolar is pleased to present George Rush: *Make-believe Love*. The show consists of a selection of drawings and prints from Rush’s recent book of over 350 drawings, *Make-believe Love*. Divided into chapters, *Make-believe Love* touches upon a wide range of subjects, including American suburbia, art history, book collections, Mies van der Rohe’s Barcelona Pavilion, aging, and gun enthusiast/survivalist magazines. At turns humorous, critical, perverse, quotidian, ethnographic, and diaristic, Rush’s drawings, done in a combination of ball-point pen and ink-jet printing, are both wry perceptions of the world around him and an exploration of his interiority.
 
The exhibition also includes *Institutional Equity*, a program of videos by eighteen artists invited by Rush: Rachel Anderson, Roger Beebe, Iris Bernblum, Derrick Buisch, Elaff Houmse, Miranda Lichtenstein, Andrew Mehall, Gina Osterloh, Matthew Pevear, Dani ReStack, Liz Roberts, Heather Rowe, Suzanne Silver, Michael Stickrod, Craig Taylor, Ry Wharton, Tommy White, Paula Wilson.
