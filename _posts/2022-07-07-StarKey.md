What There Is
In this my green world
Flowers birds are hands
They hold me
I am loved all day

All this pleases me

I am amused
I have to laugh from crying
Trees mountains are arms
I am loved all day

Children grass are tears

I cry
I am loved all day
Everything
Pompous makes me laugh
I am amused often enough
In this
My beautiful green world

There's love all day

-Kenneth Patchen

*Starkey Fossgreen* (b. 1994) is a painter based in Sebastopol, California. Fossgreen conceives of the painting process as a vessel for the whims of spirit. 
Their work explores themes of myth and enigma as the central focus, often in an amalgamated nature. The pieces themselves often appear slightly out of focus, as if woven in smoke.
