What There Is<br>
In this my green world<br>
Flowers birds are hands<br>
They hold me<br>
I am loved all day<br>

All this pleases me<br>

I am amused<br>
I have to laugh from crying<br>
Trees mountains are arms<br>
I am loved all day<br>

Children grass are tears<br>

I cry<br>
I am loved all day<br>
Everything<br>
Pompous makes me laugh<br>
I am amused often enough<br>
In this<br>
My beautiful green world<br>

There's love all day<br>

-Kenneth Patchen


**Starkey Fossgreen** (b. 1994) is a painter based in Sebastopol, California. Fossgreen conceives of the painting process as a vessel for the whims of spirit. 
Their work explores themes of myth and enigma as the central focus, often in an amalgamated nature. The pieces themselves often appear slightly out of focus, as if woven in smoke.
