**Alice Warnecke Sutro** is an artist and grape grower. She studied Art History for seven years starting with an immersive art history program in high school, then received a BA from Stanford University in Art History. As an undergraduate she studied art abroad in Florence and Moscow and has worked at Cantor Center for the Arts, Tretyakov Gallery and Sonoma County Museum. She pursued studio art and graduated from California College of the Arts MFA program in Painting and Drawing in 2010. That's when she felt the call to return to the land and moved to Healdsburg to work for her family business [Warnecke Ranch & Vineyard](https://www.warneckeranch.com). She founded the wine label [SUTRO](https://www.sutrowine.com) in 2012 to highlight the unique volcanic terroir of her family’s one hundred year old property on the Russian River. It was in 2019 that she embarked on the new medium of performative, large-scale, public engagement figurative drawing. She is president of Alexander Valley Winegrowers Association and serves on the board of [Chalk Hill Artist Residency](https://www.chalkhillresidency.com).
