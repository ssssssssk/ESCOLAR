Escolar is pleased to present two works by Ben Kinmont: *This isn’t it** from 2004 and *Untitled (the third sculpture diagrammed)* from c.1989.

This isn’t it first occurred within the context of Expat Art Centre (2004), a traveling group show curated by Mathieu Copeland that went to different museums and art centers (ICA, London; Musée Art Contemporain, Lyon; Muzeum Sztuki, Lodz, Poland; CAC Contemporary Art Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania; Kunstihoone, Tallinn, Estonia; and Bizart, Shanghai, China). The premise of Mathieu’s show was to display work in spaces usually off limits to museum visitors. The other participating artists were Brian Eno, Pierre Huyghe, Claude Leveque, Didier Marcel, Olivier Mosset, Shimabuku, Dan Walsh, and Ian Wilson. The work was later reactivated by middle school students in Noisy-le-Sec (2017) and then by Air de Paris at the Basel Art Fair (2018).

*Untitled (the third sculpture diagrammed)* comes from a series of studio works Kinmont was making during the late 1980s and early 1990s concerning his interactive projects out on the street. In his introduction to his curatorial project *The third sculpture* that appeared in *Document sur l’art** in 2000, Kinmont wrote:

>*Starting around 1987 I began to discuss my work in terms of spaces in between. My interactive projects out on the street, or in stranger’s homes, were not so important for what they generated as objects, but as a series of points, or experiences, which helped to propose a value structure for something happening outside of the gallery and museum.* 

The installation at Escolar is one of the studio works he made from this period and it is being exhibited for the first time.
