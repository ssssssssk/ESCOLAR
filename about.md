Escolar is an art and design research collective working at the intersection of regenerative agriculture and cultural production within an anti-capitalist and de-colonial framework. We maintain a curatorial practice and an exhibition venue, a residency with production facilities and support, provide design and fabrication support for local activists and maintain a one-acre experimental farm with an emphasis on native flora.
