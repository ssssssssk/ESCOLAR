I"<p>Here, a field, <br />
a wide view, <br />
an eye on the horizon<br />
within a periphery. <br />
Objects come and flow through systems <br />
we use them, <br />
we waste them, <br />
we wear them out <br />
and on the other endâ€” <br />
      the waste stream. <br />
When forms have been in the world awhile, <br />
they have a grime.<br />
Circulating and rotating <br />
through waste stream sludge, <br />
Pauses in a circuit based horizontality, <br />
supply chain blockage. <br />
We encounter through the lateral, network through a horizontal window. <br />
Feedback loops and tipping points. <br />
Approaching virtual <br />
by being close to something without actually being it. <br />
The felt distance between two poles, <br />
time-being <br />
and <br />
time-sensing.<br /></p>
